# Example - Basic
Packages:
- `Curly.EventDriven.Abstractions`
- `Curly.EventDriven.Immediate`

This example is a simple console application that allows you to grab a chocolate. All you want to do is grab a chocolate, because you like chocolate.
Taking a chocolate, however, might have some effects. But again, you like chocolate. You don't care about those effects, as long as you can keep eating chocolate.

This example isn't only to explain the usage of the package, but also to highlight the thought process behind **EventDriven Development** from a pure **Separation of Concerns** point of view.
